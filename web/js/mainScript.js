I spent more than 15 years learning the Arabic language including a short spell of nearly half a decade in Egypt, immersing myself in the culture and mastering not only classical Arabic, but also the local Egyptian slang.<nl>My journey into the tech world began in 2018, when I started learning web development sporadically. In 2022, I completed my Master's Degree in Asian Studies before embarking on a career in the tech sector. That was when I decided to give my all and pick up where I left off. Most importantly, my experiences thus far have made me realise that learning to code and understanding the syntax of different programming languages is akin to learning a language and the culture itself.<nl>Currently, I am well-versed in the essential frontend languages â€” namely, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and working my way towards understanding various backend programming languages and databases such as, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Python and Java. I have successfully completed a number of projects, showcasing my skills in both frontend and backend development. I am constantly exploring new technologies and learning new skills to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of software development. I am excited to share my knowledge and experience with you through my website. Thank you for visiting!<nl>                                     <nl>Shafeeq`
